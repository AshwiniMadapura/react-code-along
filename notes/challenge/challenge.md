# Challenge Set up and JSX

Right click on the challenge.md file and click Open Preview.

The aims of this challenge are for you to practice inserting JS into JSX and to conditionally render content on the page.

## Adding JS into JSX

1. In App.jsx create a user object. This represents a user of our app. It should have two keys firstName and lastName. You can set them to any string you like.

2. In App.jsx use the values from the user object in your jsx. Add a message greeting the user using the firstName and lastName keys from the user object.

## Conditionally Render content

1. In App.jsx based on the time variable alter the message to correctly greet the user.
   - If it is the morning the message should say "Good Morning!"
   - If it is the afternoon the message should say "Good Afternoon!"
   - If it is the evening the message should say "Good Evening!"
