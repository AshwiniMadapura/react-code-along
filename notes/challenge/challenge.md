# Challenge: Functions as Props

In VS Code right click on the challenge.md file and click "Open Preview".

## Brief

The aim of this challenge is to get you to practice adding routing to a project.

You will need to set a new link to "/rated-albums". You will need to set a new route in the app to reuse the AlbumGallery container. You will need to give it different props though.

In the image below you can see that when you go to http://localhost:3000/rated-albums it displays the AlbumGallery container but it has been given different props.

## Todo

1. Update The NavMenu component to link to the correct page.

2. Add a new Route to the Switch inside the App.

3. It is up to you to put the rest of the pieces together. Which container can we re use? What props need to given to this page?
