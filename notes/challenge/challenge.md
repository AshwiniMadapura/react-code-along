# Challenge: State

In VS Code right click on the challenge.md file and click "Open Preview".

The aim of this challenge is to get you to practice using state to show/hide some JSX.

You will need to update the DiscoverArtistCard so that when the button is clicked it causes some state to change. This will cause it to show the title, cross and text about the artist rather then the title and the button.

In the image below you can see the current component and the what it needs to look like after the button has been clicked.
